        <p>The first act of Childe's Story Quest is <strong>Mighty Cyclops' Adventure!</strong>, of the Monoceros Caeli Chapter. The player must have completed <strong>A New Star Approaches</strong> (the third act of the first chapter of the Archon quests, which is the main storyline), Xingqiu's <strong>Bookworm Swordsman</strong> quest, and must be Adventure Rank 40 to unlock this quest. During this quest, a Millelith guard entrusts the Traveler to deal with a Ruin Guard problem, by chance meeting a foreign boy from afar.</p>
        
        <h3>Across the Sea</h3>
        <p>Daipai, a Millelith agent sent to patrol Minlin, reports to the Traveler and Paimon about a strange Ruin Guard "breakout", all from a single ruin. The Millelith have been assigned to keep the surrounding areas safe from harm. Upon dealing with one, the group spots a young boy addressing an inactive Ruin Guard as "Mr. Cyclops", which is based off his favorite toy given by his older brother. He introduces himself as Teucer, a young Snezhnayan boy, and asks the Traveler to help him find his brother who works as a "toy seller" in Liyue. Teucer hands over a bag of Mora, which narrows down the location to the Northland bank.</p>

        <p>Once they arrive at the bank, they spot Childe in the lobby. Teucer runs up to him addressing him as "brother", much to the Traveler and Paimon's surprise, as they were unaware of their relationship to one another. Childe, meanwhile, is shocked that Teucer managed to get to Liyue from Snezhnaya on his own. After a brief reunion, Childe pulls the Traveler aside and explains that he pretends he is a toy seller in front of his brother as he thinks Teucer is too young to know of his involvement in the Fatui. He requests the Traveler to babysit Teucer while he deals with business at Qingxu Pool and offers them additional funds for Teucer's entertainment.</p>

        <h3>Teucer's Terrific Tour</h3>
        <p>After the Traveler tours Teucer around Liyue, during which Teucer brags about Childe's achievements, he tells the Traveler and Paimon that he misses his brother, so they venture off to Qingxu Pool. They find Childe negotiating with a trio of Treasure Hoarders regarding debt. Teucer's presence forces Childe to use a different approach by asking if he can join their group. To "qualify", the Hoarders make Childe get a treasure they have been struggling to take for two days. He does so with ease, much to the thieves' shock; they politely decline his request to join their group, but agree to pay their debts.</p>

        <p>All of a sudden, Felix, one of the Fatui diplomats sent to Liyue, comes in and reports to Childe that some Fatui recruits are awaiting orientation near The Chasm, since he is the only available harbinger in Liyue after La Signora had left. He reluctantly leaves to train them, with the Traveler and Teucer following him. He arrives and speaks with some skirmishers before noticing his brother and improvises once more, bewildering the recruits. Acknowledging that he's going too far to cover up, he simply asks the recruits to spar with him, which excites them and takes their minds off the strange introduction. After the session, he dismisses them, expecting good results.</p>

        <p>Teucer is impressed by the show and asks Childe to teach him how to fight so he can protect the rest of their family back in Snezhnaya. After some convincing, Teucer agrees to go back home under the condition that Childe will take him to see Liyue's "Institute for Toy Research".</p>

        <h3>Defender of Childhood Dreams</h3>
        <p>Childe takes the group to a facility, which the Traveler recognizes as the ruins from which the Ruin Guard problem manifested. He reveals that the "toy institute" is actually a Ruin Guard facility abandoned by Il Dottore, the Third Fatui Harbinger. He has the Traveler assist him in clearing away nearby enemies as he tries to show Teucer around safely. They are led into a large area where Teucer believes the Ruin Guards are made. Childe tells his brother he has a surprise for him and asks him to close his eyes and count down from 60, to buy him time into getting rid of the Ruin Guards' activity. Childe ends up having to use his Foul Legacy transformation to destroy the waves of Ruin Guards and the machine producing them, but ends up hurting himself in the process as he hadn't completely recovered from his bout in the Golden House with the Traveler.</p>

        <p>When Teucer uncovers his eyes, he is awed by the pile of Ruin Guards and begins to look for Childe alongside the Traveler. The latter finds him tucked in a corner, where he hands them a Mr. Cyclops Action Figure. He had ordered it and intended to give it to his brother once he had returned from Liyue, but decided that now was better than later. Paimon suggests that he visits a doctor. After the Traveler agrees to his request, he discreetly leaves the area.</p>

        <p>The Traveler returns to Teucer, who upon finding out that Childe had to leave so abruptly, becomes upset. The Traveler hands him the action figure which immediately lifts his mood, and agrees to return to Snezhnaya. When they return to the bank, a Fatui agent named Andrei is waiting and informs Teucer that his boat to Snezhnaya is ready to leave. Teucer thanks them for the adventure and departs.</p>

        <p>Childe comes out of hiding and thanks the Traveler for helping him with his cover story, offering compensation. He also demands a rematch and extends an invitation to come visit his family when they have the chance.</p>
