        <p>The first act of Hu Tao's Story Quest is <strong>Yet the Butterfly Flutters Away</strong>, of the Papilio Charontis Chapter. The player must have completed <strong>Farewell, Archaic Lord</strong> (the second act of the first chapter of the Archon quests, which is the main storyline) quest, and must be Adventure Rank 40 to unlock this quest. During this quest, the Traveler assists the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor director's unpaid intern solve his paranormal problem since his childhood.</p>

        <h3>The Mysterious Wangsheng Parlor</h3>
        <p>While travelling through Liyue's Wuwang Hill, Paimon is jittery and nervous, believing someone is about to ambush them. All of a sudden, they run into someone named Meng, who panics and flees, believing they are spirits from the other side despite Paimon's denial of this.</p>
        
        <p>The Traveler and Paimon chase Meng and catch up to him frantically explaining to his boss that ghosts are after him. His boss notices the pair and chastises Meng, telling him he is paranoid and that the duo are not, in fact, ghosts seeking revenge, but are "future clients". She tells the pair that Meng is a new undertaker intern and that they are performing funerals. Paimon makes the connection that they work at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, recalling the name from Zhongli, who works there as a consultant.</p>

        <p>The girl is surprised that they know of Zhongli and introduces herself as Hu Tao, 77th Director of the Parlor. She attempts to market her business through a strange gimmick, but fails. Meng explains that he and Hu Tao came to Wuwang Hill to perform a funeral after they had heard rumors of strange supernatural activity in the area. Hu Tao is aware that the Traveler and Paimon do not belong in the area and learns from them that they are on an adventure. At first, she assumes they are from the Adventurers' Guild and recruits them into accompanying her as an intermediary, before learning that they are looking for someone – the Traveler's sibling.</p>

        <p>The group returns to Liyue and go to Liyue Harbor's Adventurers' Guild branch, where Hu Tao tries to negotiate with Lan on a business deal; however, her overenthusiastic outlook on the opportunity of death immediately puts the branch manager off. Dismayed, Hu Tao returns with them to the funeral parlor and brainstorms ideas with Meng helping them. Hu Tao finishes planning and prepares to leave, but not before Meng reminds her of "Big G". Hu Tao has the Traveler accompany her to meet several "future clients" — including Little Wu, Mumu, and Congzi — but her attempts to promote the parlor fail due to her eccentric way of advertising death.</p>

        <p>Hu Tao then reveals that she wasn't being serious about the marketing — the three people they had visited were friends of Meng, and she suspected Big G had been hiding nearby. She hadn't sensed anything, however, so she dropped the conversation when she could. This strategy left Paimon rather surprised.</p>

        <h3>In Pursuit of a Phantom</h3>
        <p>Once they return to the parlor, Hu Tao explains to the Traveler that Meng is worried about Big G's fate. Big G was Meng's childhood friend who passed in an unfortunate accident. Meng had been worried that Big G had become a vengeful spirit, despite Hu Tao's reassurances that she rarely saw evil spirits in her line of work. Just as they are running out of leads, a man named Luocheng runs in and tells the trio that he suspects he is cursed by a demon due to feeling ill.</p>

        <p>Hu Tao tasks Meng with performing an exorcism ritual and that she had taught him while she prepares the exorcism site with the Traveler. Arriving at the site, she tells the Traveler that the men are being paranoid and that there is no curse. She explains some people are so paranoid that she has to tell them something believable, which is why she keeps them in the dark for their own safety.</p>

        <p>She also tells them about an ancient plague that formed as a result of accumulated Yaksha karma from fighting the vengeful gods, which hysterical people took as a curse from the gods. The plague killed many until some realized that the spread could be stopped by purifying the air and burning diseased corpses - the founders of the parlor. With their aid, they managed to eradicate the plague after many long years, having ensured the balance between life and death ever since. She decides to use the Ley Line Monolith as a prop to "exorcise" the curse.</p>

        <p>Some time later, both men arrive, and Hu Tao starts the "ritual". The Traveler repels oncoming Hilichurls attracted by the Ley Line Monolith, allowing the exorcism to be completed. To Luocheng's delight, he says he feels "cured". Hu Tao then tells him that he has been pranked, stating that the monsters were actually real, but it was the Ley Line Monolith attracting them to the site. She asked how exactly he felt better, upon which he realizes that there was no curse at all. Hu Tao deems that he was probably simply scared sick and tells him not to believe such superstitions in the future.</p>

        <p>Meng is relieved that the "curse" was not Big G's doing, but states that he still wants to find him. Hu Tao tells him that Big G has already found them – at this, his spirit appears almost immediately before the four. Paimon expresses surprise as he is a lot smaller than his nickname suggested, to which Hu Tao explains that spirits take the form they had when they died. They bring Big G's spirit to the parlor.</p>

        <h3>Friendships, Wishes, and Regrets</h3>
        <p>Returning to the parlor, Hu Tao deduces that Big G is unable to return to Wuwang Hill, which he confirms, saying he simply wanted to check up on his old friends and had no intention of harming anyone. He explains that he had trailed Luocheng on his way back to Liyue Harbor, explaining Luocheng feeling ill. However, with Big G's poor sense of direction and acrophobia, he got lost until the Monolith attracted him to the site. Meng is relieved that Big G has not become a vengeful spirit.</p>

        <p>Hu Tao then tells them that in order to send Big G back in peace, they need to prepare a funeral with keepsakes from his friends. While she and Meng leave to prepare the site, she asks the Traveler to ask for keepsakes from their earlier "clients". Little Wu prepares some extra-spicy Jueyun Chili Chicken, Mumu gives them a toy box, and Congzi prepares a Xiao Lantern. They know that Meng has been troubled ever since Big G died, but decide not to pry more, suspecting that the Traveler asked them for the items to commemorate Big G and to tell him that they are doing well.</p>

        <h3>Perfect Send-Off</h3>
        <p>With the keepsakes, the pair return to Wuwang Hill where Hu Tao, Meng, and Big G wait. Hu Tao explains that they are about to travel and cross over the border between life and death. She warns them to follow her instructions to a T, otherwise she would have to wipe their memories.</p>

        <p>Once they arrive at the border, they reach the farewell ceremony site. Hu Tao gives Meng and Big G space to talk; the Traveler follows her lead. While they wait, Hu Tao explains to the Traveler that the Funeral Parlor was more like a doctor's office in its early days, but during the Archon Wars, the balance between life and death was skewed more towards the latter. Of course, the balance was restored, but the fallen gods stirred up so much trouble to the point the balance would tip again. Eventually, after many years, the balance was restored once more, shaping Liyue into what it is today.</p>

        <p>Noticing that Meng and Big G have finished talking, Hu Tao tells the Traveler to return to Wuwang Hill. Although Big G is upset that he and Meng have not upheld their promises, Meng reassures him that no life is without regrets. Big G moves on peacefully, knowing that his friends are well. Meng finds himself unusually empty and says that his wish will be a dream. Paimon asked what they had wished for, and he replies that he and Big G wanted to build a successful career, have a family, and then spend time together at a Lantern Rite. Hu Tao allows Meng on his unpaid leave so he can process his emotions properly; as he leaves, Paimon remarks that she might've forgotten something.</p>

        <p>Hu Tao observes that based on the Traveler's reaction that they hadn't found what they were looking for. She says that she had also asked the dead for information that might help the Traveler, but to no avail. She promises to keep looking on their behalf.</p>

        <p>Hu Tao remarks that while they were in the border, the site was a place where the dead still envied the world of the living, or were unable to move on. She had not seen any of Wangsheng's previous directors in any of her visits, so she knows that they had all passed with no regrets.</p>
