        <p>The first act of Zhongli's Story Quest is <strong>Sal Flore</strong>, of the Historia Antiqua Chapter. The player must have completed <strong>A New Star Approaches</strong> (the third act of the first chapter of the Archon quests, which is the main storyline) and must be Adventure Rank 40 to unlock this quest. During this quest, the Traveler assists Zhongli in helping two self-proclaimed archeologists to uncover the truth about the God of Salt.</p>

        <h3>Shadow of Yore</h3>
        <p>The start of the quest is marked by the Traveler's arrival to the Pearl Galley. The Traveler runs into Zhongli and several other archeologists discussing the origin and whereabouts of the first Mora, the currency in the world of Teyvat. A Fatui agent named Kliment appears as everyone is listening to Zhongli. The Traveler and Paimon are on high alert due to their well-placed mistrust in the Fatui, but Kliment insists that he has no malicious intent and is registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs. He claims that he has hired Zhongli as a consultant for archeological research. During this conversation, a Liyuen archeologist by the name of Wanyan joins in. Zhongli requests the Traveler to accompany them, much to Kliment's vexation, but he begrudgingly allows the Traveler to come after Zhongli mentions treasure.</p>
            
        <h3>Vortex's Wake</h3>
        <p>Their first destination is Guyun Stone Forest. Kliment doubts that there can be anything worth finding, but Zhongli tells him that many ancient gods were sealed away by Rex Lapis, Liyue's archon – who, the Traveler found out, was Zhongli himself – and would thus leave behind an interesting history. Zhongli accompanies the Traveler in exploring while Wanyan and Kliment go their separate ways. The Traveler finds a stone tablet containing traces of divine power, as observed by Zhongli. They return to the other two archeologists, who are arguing with each other over lack of experience. Zhongli notices the teacup they had found and advises that it may not be wise for Kliment to sell it as it had been Ningguang's, who was the Liyue Tianquan, unless he wanted to invoke the wrath of the Liyue Qixing.</p>

        <h3>A Ruin Under Lock and Key</h3>
        <p>Kliment decides to head for Sal Terrae to search for more treasure. Once they arrive, they learn from Zhongli that the area had had many treasures at some point, but were most likely pilfered by Treasure Hoarders, much to Kliment's annoyance. Wanyan says she knows of a ruin in the area, but adds that it is sealed and that she has no knowledge of how to unseal it, despite having found a mechanism.</p>

        <p>Zhongli states that there is more than one mechanism, and leads them to another one with several Electro Elemental Monuments nearby. He mentions that the monuments must be activated in a specific order and recites a puzzle hidden in a poem, which the Traveler manages to decipher and activates the monuments, which unseals the ruins.</p>
            
        <p>Before they venture further, Zhongli, preferring not to have to witness more petty arguing, negotiates a contract with Wanyan and Kliment. The contract states that they may get one item from the ruins, and leave the next item for the other person. If they broke their claimed item, Zhongli would leave. Kliment reluctantly agrees, while Wanyan argues back that he should judge the God of Salt's fate if they found the truth about her, even if it hurt Rex Lapis' image, to which Zhongli agreed.</p>

        <h3>Farewell, Sweet Salt</h3>
        <p>With the contract sealed, they enter the ruins. Their first discovery is a chalice, which Kliment immediately claims once Zhongli tells him it will never run out of salt, intending to use the endless salt as a resource to sell. They next find a ruler that is automatically Wanyan's per the contract. Zhongli states that the ruler can make an endless bumper harvest of salt based on how deep it is. Kliment, fueled by greed and irritation with having to share the treasures with Wanyan, announces that he is breaking the contract. Zhongli is displeased with this turn of events and easily defeats Kliment. He confiscates the chalice and warns him to never return.</p>

        <p>As Kliment leaves, Zhongli turns to Wanyan and states that neither she nor Kliment came on the expedition for archeology. He notes her lack of knowledge on the basics of archeology itself, yet she is ready to explain anything regarding the God of Salt. Wanyan admits that she is indeed not a scholar of archeology, but is instead a follower of the God of Salt. She confesses that she wanted evidence that Morax was evil and had been the one to kill the God of Salt.</p>
            
        <p>They proceed further into the ruins and find a broken sword. Zhongli tells Wanyan she can only claim half of it, much to her disbelief, as she believed it had been nulled when Kliment broke it. She insists she cannot take only half of the sword, unable to restore it to discover what it was used for, and decides that she will break the contract in favor of her faith to the God of Salt. Zhongli decides to tell her the truth as punishment, which is that the sword in front of them was used to murder Havria, the name of the goddess.</p>
    
        <p>Baffled and enraged, Wanyan runs further into the ruins, with Zhongli, the Traveler, and Paimon in close pursuit. They come across even more salinized statues, including a body which the Traveler recognizes as the killer. Zhongli explains that when Havria was betrayed by her followers, her powers were too strong for them to handle, which salinized them; those who managed to escape fled to Liyue under Morax's rule. Their descendants feared Havria's remnants and lived in terror that she had placed an eternal curse upon them. They risked their lives to enter the ruins and break the sword, hoping the goddess's anger would be appeased, yet it was a fruitless act. Wanyan, in disbelief and denial, leaves the ruins; Zhongli confiscates the ruler as she does so.</p>

        <h3>A Record of All Things</h3>
        <p>Zhongli tells the Traveler to meet him at Guyun Stone Forest after Wanyan's departure.</p>

        <p>The Traveler returns to the forest and meets Zhongli at the highest peak. Zhongli reminisces that during his time as Rex Lapis, he wrote history with his own hands, but the recent events made him realize that he needed another way to document history and keep the truth. He tells the Traveler that he had them come along because they would be able to retain Teyvat's history should something happen to it. He then throws Havria's relics into the sea to resign them to their fate. With the journey concluded, Zhongli extends an invitation to the Traveler that they are welcome to assist him when he wishes to preserve Liyue's past.</p>
